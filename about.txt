Livecloud Manager is an application to help you create and edit tables and projects in LiveCloud


CassiaDB Architecture

CassiaDB is the database technology used to power Livecloud. It is a RAM database that allows storage to both local and cloud. It is written in Livecode and built for Livecode. CassiaDB takes advantage of Livecode Arrays to provide fast access to data in your LC applications, and can be deployed anywhere an LC app can be deployed.

Locally, your entire database, including your CDB libraries, configuration, and data, is contained in one folder, named "CassiaDB". This is considered the full "SDK" for a project. Note that all your local records are saved to disk within this folder. This means that your local data is specific to each application, as opposed to having one single database for the entire computer/device.

Quick Start Guide

In order to use CassiaDB in a Livecode stack, you will need to get a copy of your libraries, get a copy of your configuration, set your auth key, and load the CDB_Starter library in your stack. This can all be done through the LiveCloud Manager (LCM).
* Export your SDK from LCM
* Copy the start up code onto the first card of your stack
* Restart Livecode and re-open your stack
* Your stack now has access to CassiaDB and the Livecloud webservice!

Starter code in-depth

We recommend that you load the CassiaDB libraries on preOpenStack of your main stack. We recommend that you put the actual preOpenStack handler on your first card, because if you have substacks of your main stack, these will also pass a preOpenStack message. You can start using the CDB libraries anywhere in your code, as long as you have first set the global "gCDBAuthKey"
