## About CanelaDB

CanelaDB is a database designed just for LiveCode developers. As the database of the LiveCloud suite, CanelaDB makes it easy to read, write, store and query data both locally and on the cloud.

CanelaDB is compatible with the same platforms LiveCode supports. Thus, you can develop on the following desktop operating systems: Macintosh, Windows, and Linux. You can deploy LiveCode standalone executables with CanelaDB on desktops and mobile devices with complete feature parity.

These are the steps to setting up your CanelaDB ToolKit (cSDK). Working with the cSDK requires a Business or Indy edition of LiveCode. The LiveCode Community edition is not compatible with CanelaDB at this time. LiveCode needs to be running at all times when interacting with the cSDK.
