##Commonly used terms

* Project - A **project** is an organizational structure that groups a set of tables together. When you build applications that use LiveCloud, you should have a different **project** for each application. Using LiveCloud Manager, you can specify what tables each project should have access to. You can put many different tables into one project, and you can also share tables across different projects.
* Table - A **table** is the basic structure in which you can store data. Every table has a set of *keys* which define structure of the table. You can save *records* into a table, each of which must match the *keys* of the table. An ID key is automatically generated by CassiaDB, so it does not need to be user-defined. e.g. A "Person" table may include a firstName, lastName, and email keys. Every record would then have a firstName, lastName, and email (which could be empty).

* Record - A single piece of datum stored in a table; a Row of the table. Every **record** must match the *keys* that the table specifies.
* Key - Defines a part of a table; can be thought of as the column header of the table.
