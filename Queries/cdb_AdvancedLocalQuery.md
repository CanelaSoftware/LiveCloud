cdb_advancedLocalQuery
======================
`function cdb_AdvancedLocalQuery pQuerySetA, pLogicMap, pClientDatabasename, pOutputFormat`

**Summary:**  
This function searches the specified local database using provided queries, applies the logical operations detailed in the pLogicMap, and returns the resulting subset in several possible formats.

**Inputs:**  
`pQuerySetA` *(Array)* - A set of one or more search queries; each query's key should be a single word, and correspond to one (or more) in the pLogicMap.  
`pLogicMap` *(String)* - The order and method in which the queries' results are combined.  
`pClientDatabaseName`\* *(String)* - The label of the database to access, or the working database if empty.  
`pOutputFormat`\* *(String)* - The output format to use, from the following options:
* `recordList` - A line-delimited String of the matching cdbRecordIDs. (This is the default if no format is provided.)
* `structured` - A multidimensional Array of parsed, expanded database information.

**Outputs:**  
*(String or Array)* - Varies based on 'pOutputFormat' parameter; see description above.

**Logic Map Syntax:**  
The logic map is formatted as a String that can be parenthetically nested, with the following logical set operations:
* 'AND' - The intersection of the results.
* 'OR' - The union of the results.
* 'XOR' - The symmetric difference of the results.

```
//list all users named 'Mark Miller' or 'Mark Stevens'
put cdb_BuildQuery("firstName","=","Mark") into tQuerySetA["FnMark"]
put cdb_BuildQuery("lastName","=","Miller") into tQuerySetA["LnMiller"]
put cdb_BuildQuery("lastName","=","Stevens") into tQuerySetA["LnStevens"]
get cdb_AdvancedLocalQuery(tQuerySetA,"((FnMark AND LnMiller) OR (FnMark AND LnStevens))","Users","recordList")
